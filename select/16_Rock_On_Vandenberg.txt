Alright!

They say life is just a threat, they know what is good and bad
I know what I want, no one tells me what to do - alright!

They say life ain't just for fun, but my life has just begun
I'm not gonna waste it, I'll take my piece of the cake

Chorus:
I'm gonna rock on - gotta let yourself go, just let it blow
Rock on - gotta let yourself go, just let it blow

Let it blow, yeah

They say rock music's bad, well I'm not so sure 'bout that
'Cos if it's so bad, how come I'm feeling so good?

(Chorus)

Ain't gonna listen to them, I'm gonna have fun
It's my life that I'm living, I'm gonna rock on, I'm gonna rock on
Give it to them!

(Solo)

Rock on - gonna let yourself go, just let it blow
Rock on - gonna let yourself go, just let it blow
Rock on - I'm gonna rock on, rock on
Why don't you rock on, why don't you let, why don't you let
Why don't you let yourself go
