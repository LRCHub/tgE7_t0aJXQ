Hey kids, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh, my soul
Hey kids, boogie too, did you?

Hey, shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes
Hey kids, rock and roll, rock on

And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Still looking for that blue-jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen
Jimmy Dean

Jimmy Dean, rock on

Hey kids, boogie too (Rock on)
