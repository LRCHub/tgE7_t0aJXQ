Tears on the pillow is all you leave behind
And the only thing you know this time
Is it's time to let go? So put the key under the mat
And don't you look back

Just rock on, yeah baby, rock on
You ain't got nothing to lose that ain't already gone
'Cause trapped in these blues, ain't where you belong
So baby, rock on

Let the songs and the static fight for the dial
Inside an addict's last passing mile
Well, I know it ain't easy but the wheel's in your hands
And who knows where you'll land

So just rock on, yeah baby, rock on
You ain't got nothing to lose that ain't already gone
And may the good Lord God bless you and help you along
Now baby, rock on

And baby don't stop, just rock on, yeah, baby, rock on
You ain't got nothing to lose that ain't already gone
I know your heart's black and blue, babe, but life don't last long
Now baby, rock on

Baby, rock on
Baby, rock on
Yeah baby, rock on
