Hey, did you rock and roll, rock on
Hey, did you rock and roll, rock on
Hey, did you rock and roll, rock on
Oh my soul, hey did you boogie too, did ya'?
Hey, shout sometime blues, jump up down the blues way shoes
Hey, did you rock and roll, rock on

And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?
Still looking for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean (James Dean)
