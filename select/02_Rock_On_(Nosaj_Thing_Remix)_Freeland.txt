Hey kid, rock and roll
Rock on, lose your soul
Hey kid, they got through
To you

Scream, shout, leave no doubt
Jump up and down til you all black out
Hey kid, rock and roll
Rock on

Where do we go from here
Which is the way that's clear

Still looking for that
New scene, where you been
Working for the man on the devil's scheme
See your fake in the magazine
Bitter screen (bad dream)

Rock on

Still looking for that
New scene, where you been
Working for the man on the devil's scheme
See your fake in the magazine
Bitter screen (bad dream)

Rock on
